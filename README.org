** Installation

   Dependencies to clone in local-projects (see =make install=):

: https://github.com/vindarel/cl-torrents

: https://github.com/40ants/weblocks

: https://github.com/40ants/weblocks-ui

This project and its dependencies are also available in the [[https://ultralisp.org/][Ultralisp]] distribution.


To build an executable:

: make build

Debian dependencies are =libreadline-dev=, =libssl-dev=, =libssl1.0.2=.

Run it:

: ./torrents-web
#+BEGIN_SRC text
 <INFO> [16:35:53] weblocks/server server.lisp (start) -
  Starting weblocks WEBLOCKS/SERVER::PORT: 40000
  WEBLOCKS/SERVER::SERVER-TYPE: :HUNCHENTOOT DEBUG: T
#+END_SRC

And access it on http://localhost:4000/torrents (with the =torrents= suffix).

** Deployment on one's private server

There is nothing special to deploy the  app to one's VPS. Just run the
excecutable and  access the  app from your  browser.  For  options and
troubleshooting see https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/web-dev/#shipping


** Development notes

- after compiling a function and a  page refresh, we keep the state of
  the app. Only a =reset= looses it. That's nice.

** Troubleshooting

#+BEGIN_SRC text
Don't know how to REQUIRE sb-cltl2.
#+END_SRC

Set =SBCL_HOME= to the output of =(sb-int:sbcl-homedir-pathname)=.


** LICENCE

WTF public licence.
